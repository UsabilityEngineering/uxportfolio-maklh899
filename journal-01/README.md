### My Experience

In my job's break room we have a paper shredder. I needed to use it because I had to shred a 3 in. x 3 in. Post-it Note as it had confiedential information on it. When I went to go shred it I was stumped a little. First, I had to figure how to start the shredding. In the zoomed in view there are three buttons, even though the machine's company but much emphahsis on the first button I was hesistant as it did not look right to me, instead of "I" why not "O" for On or "S" for Start. Later when thinking over it, I acknowledged "I" is for In, "O" mean Out, but I still do not know what "R" stands for. This confusion of the buttons and their purpose is an example of how poor the machine's *visibility* is. Visibilty is the principle that correct parts must be visible, and they must convey the correct message. For the buttons, they did somewhat have the right message but they were not **naturally interpretive**, and so I was conscious of my actions when using the shredder.

After deciding to push the "I" button nothing happened. I went to push the other buttons - nothing happend. I realized, the machine itself was not on. The switch to the top right corner showed me how to turn it on but there was no *feedback*, or a useful message saying an actions has occured, that the machine is on. On the other, this is another reason why the lacked in *visibilty*, the button was behind the shredder pressed against the wall. To fix both of these problems, the shredder's company can move the switch to the top of the machine so it will be visible to the user and show that the machine is on.

On the positive side, the shredder had proper *affordances* as it showed where in the machine a user can insert an item. Affordances are the fundamental properties that determine how something can be used. The shredder had two thin slots, one for bigger objects and another for smaller ones. If it had bigger slots, one could not easily tell the machine is mainly for paper, disc, credit cards, etc.- thin objects.
